# Basics

## Repository with some code to grab idea about random and monte carlo methods

*in run.py:*
1. Find calculus from 0 to pi of sine function using monte carlo method
-- Analytical solution: 2/pi
2. Find standard deviation of simulation results in number of samples function
3. Plot results of simulation depending on dimensions of sine calculus
4. Do the same for ranlux() generated samples
in genere
*in generate_ranlux.cpp*
5. Measure time for random() generation and ranlux generation of 1.000.000 samples
